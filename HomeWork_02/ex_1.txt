1 - Why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?

ans - Because somtimes we want a function to be called after I/O.

2 - The differance between process.nextTick and setImmediate?

ans - Both of them are queues but setImmediate queue is a part of the Event Loop queues and it has and order between queues to be excuted on the other hand process,nextTick is a seperate queue and it has the highest pioraity in all of the queues and anything that will be added to it will be called first.
